# BiPoLAR-3ds
<b> Bifunctional Power Light AdministratoR. </b>
* Bifunctional: has two main functions - to disable, and to enable the power LED.
* Also displays your battery level. Just totally by the way. Since I got mcuhwc initialised anyway.

It's really simple, but still very useful for playing during the night.

Power LED is reset on: sleep and reboot (not soft reboot, like Smash does on o3DS).

Tested working on o3DSL XL A9LH Luma 6.2.2. Tested means I ran it on my console without trying to break it, without putting it to sleep, just as it was intented to use, then ran a normal mode game and an extended mode game. Please don't try to break it.

There's no warranty on this software. I am not responsible for bricks, loneliness and atomic conflicts.

While it compiles to 3dsx, there's little chance it will work. Maybe when launched from HBLL, but then what's the point?
